## Project Overview

This project aims to create a simple video card capable of producing a rendered image on a screen through VGA with the end goal of emulating a pipeline in a similar vein to modern graphics processors.

## Educational Value Added

As someone with a heavy interest in computer architecture and graphics, this project will allow me to better understand the hardware design decisions when making a parallelized architecture. It is a unique challenge to typical computer architecutre since it relies on parallel execution rather than the typical sequential execution of a CPU.
